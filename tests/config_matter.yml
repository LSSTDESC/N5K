# A few notes about this submission:

# You can compile the program by typing

# ->   cd utils
# ->   make clean
# ->   make -j
# ->   cd ..

# Then, you can run the calculator_matter.py as you would run any other calculator
# (e.g. from the example.py file)

output_prefix: tests/matter
verbosity: 1

# For a given required accuracy, the below parameters can be adjusted to give faster speeds!

# Sizes for actual calculation (smaller is faster, but less accurate)
size_FFTlog : 60                          # <-- Number of FFT coefficients
size_chi_window_array : 40                # <-- Number of time points for time integrals for clustering
size_chi_window_array_integrated : 75     # <-- Number of time points for time integrals for shear
size_t_array : 60                         # <-- Number of t samples for final t integration

# Array of L sampling values
l_logstep : 1.4                           # <-- Logarithmic sampling stepsize for small L (bigger is faster)
l_linstep : 75                            # <-- Linear stepsize for large L (bigger is faster)
lmax : 2000                               # <-- Maximum value of l (smaller is faster)

# Is everything seperable in k<->tau? This is NOT true if massive neutrinos or nonlinear corrections are present
# This IS true if only a linear matter power spectrum (with scale-invariant growth) is considered
# True == much much faster, but cannot always be used
seperable : False

# Sizes for preparation of calculation (these usually need not be changed, smaller is faster)
size_prep_t_array : 150                   # <-- Number of t samples for intermediate steps
size_prep_chi_window_array : 800          # <-- Number of time points for intermediate steps (clustering)
size_prep_chi_window_array_integrated : 1600 # <-- Number of time points for intermediate steps (shear)
size_prep_FFTlog : 256                    # <-- Number of FFT coefficients befor any cutoff !! HAS to be a power of 2 for speed reasons !!

# Minimal k value, shouldn't matter too much (please leave fixed)
k_min : 1e-7
